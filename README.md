### A simple environment that models Minecraft search and rescue (SAR) scenarios

Part of the [DARPA ASIST project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/artificial-social-intelligence-for-successful-teams). This is a low-fidelity abstraction of the video game Minecraft, built using graphs and Python data structures, used to train RL algorithms and find the best policies (i.e. those that match the behaviors of humans when they play the SAR scenario in Minecraft.)
